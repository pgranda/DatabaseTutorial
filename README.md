## Brief:
Mentioned tutorial is my approach to the problem, which was the integration of Unity and reliable database. Because of the simplicity and being open-sourced software, SQLite was a choice here. In the tutorial I am writing and explaining the best I can how the code works, and what should be taken in consideration while designing the database.

### Note:
As mentioned in video, but I feel it would be fair to say that one more time. The basis of the project, assets, movement mechanics, camera, animations - were created from YouTube tutorial "How to make an RPG in Unity" by Brackeys and Sebastian Lague. This environment really helped me to create this tutorial, to visualize how the databases work.
